[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/voomify/egregious.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/voomify/egregious)
##### Update Log:
  * Version 0.3.0 
    - Added Rails 5 support
    - Removed Airbrake 4 support
    - Added gem lockfiles

  * Version 0.2.13 Added Airbrake rack env to notifications for Airbrake 4 and 5

  * Version 0.2.12 Added support for Airbrake 5

  * Version 0.2.11 Fixed the development behavior that does not show the debugging screens when exceptions
  are thrown. Now when in development you will get the rails default exception handling screens for html requests.

##### What is Egregious?
Egregious is a rails based exception handling gem for well defined http exception handling for
json, xml and html.

If you have a json or xml api into your rails application, you probably have added your own exception handling to map
exceptions to a http status and formatting your json and xml output.  We decided to create egregious. One of the goals
is to start providing a more consistent api error experience for all rails applications. As of the creation of
egregious the behavior of rails was to return html when an exception is thrown with the status code of 500.  With
egregious proper json and html of the error will be returned with a good default mapping of exceptions to http status
codes.  This allows api developers to respond to the status code properly, instead of scratching their head with 500's
coming back all the time. If the problem was the api caller then the result codes are in the 300 range. If the problem
was on the server then the status codes are in the 500 range.  The returned exception message and exception type
provide the caller context information.

 What egregious can do:

 * Defines default exception handling for most common ruby, rails, warden, cancan and mongoid exceptions.
   (warden, cancan and mongoid are optional)
 * Catches defined exceptions using a rescue_with returning the status code defined for each exception
   and well structured json, xml
 * For html production requests attempts to load the html error pages for the mapped status code,
   falling back to the 500.html page.
 * Defines exceptions for all http status codes allowing you to throw these exceptions anywhere in your code.
 * Allows you to change the exception mapping to fit your needs, adding exceptions and changing status mapping.
 * If Airbrake is defined it will send the errors to Airbrake.
 * The error will be logged with stack trace


##### REQUIRES:
  rails > 3.0, < 5.0
  rack  >= 1.3.6

##### USAGE:
1) Add to your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'egregious'
```

2) In your ApplicationController add:
```ruby
include Egregious
```

##### KNOWN ISSUES:
* If you use Mongoid, CanCan or Devise you must have Egregious after CanCan/Devise in your Gemfile, if not it will not handle those errors correctly.

##### Implementation Notes
If you have a json or xml api into your rails application, you probably
have added your own exception handling to map exceptions to a http status and formatting your json and xml output.


You probably have code sprinkled about like this:

```ruby
rescue_from CanCan::AccessDenied do |exception|
 flash[:alert] = exception.message
 respond_to do |format|
 format.html { redirect_to dashboard_path }
 format.xml {
      render :xml => exception.to_xml, :status => :forbidden }
 format.json { render :json=>
      exception.to_json, :status => :forbidden }
 end
end
```

This example is straight from the CanCan docs. You'll notice a couple of things here. This handles the
CanCan::AccessDenied exception only. It then will redirect to the startup page, or render xml and json returning
the http status code of :forbidden (403). You can see one of the first features of the Egregious gem. We extend
Exception to add the to_xml and to_json methods. These return a well structured error that can be consumed by the
API client.
```ruby
Exception.new("Hi Mom").to_xml
```
returns:
```xml
<errors>
    <error>Hi Mom</error>
    <type>Exception</type>
</errors>
```
```ruby
Exception.new("Hi Dad").to_json
```
returns:
```json
{"error":"Hi Dad", "type":"Exception"}
```

So that's pretty handy in itself. Now all exceptions have a json and xml api that describe them. It happens to be the same
xml and json that is returned from the errors active record object, with the addition of the type element. That
allows you to mix and match validations and exceptions. Wow, big deal. We'll it is. If you are writing a client
then you need to have a very well defined error handling. I'd like to see all of rails do this by default. So that
anyone interacting with a rails resource has a consistent error handling experience. (Expect more on being a good
REST API in future posts.) As a client we can now handle errors in a consistent way.

Besides the error message we would like a well defined mapping of classes of exceptions to http status codes. The idea is
that if I get back a specific http status code then I can program against that 'class' of problems. For example if
I know that what I did was because of invalid input from my user, I can display that message back to the user.
They can correct it and continue down the path. But if the Http status code says that it was a problem with the
server, then I know that I need to log it and notify someone to see how to resolve it.

We handle all exceptions of a given class with a mapping to an http status code. With all the most common Ruby,
Rails, Devise, Warden and CanCan exceptions having reasonable defaults. (Devise, Warden and CanCan are all
optional and ignored if their gems are not installed.)

As of 0.2.9 you can also define a
method named 'http_status' on the exception and it will be used as the status code. This is a nice pattern that
allows you to raise an exception and specify the status code. The Egregious::Error allows you to do this as a
second parameter to initialize:

```ruby
raise Egregious::Error.new("My very bad error", :payment_required)
```


 If the problem
was the api caller then the result codes are in the 300 range. If the problem was on the server then the status
codes are in the 500 range.

I'm guessing if you bother to read this far, you are probably
interested in using Egregious. Its simple to use and configure. To install:

In you Gemfile
add the following:

```ruby
gem 'egregious'
```



In
your ApplicationController class add the following at or near the top:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include Egregious
    # your code ...
end
```



That's it. You will now get
reasonable api error handling.

If you want to add your own exceptions to http status codes
    end
mappings, or change the defaults add an initializer and put the following into it:


```ruby
Egregious.exception_codes.merge!({NameError => :bad_request})
```


Here
you can re-map anything and you can add new mappings.

Note: If you think the default
exception mappings should be different, please contact me @rx via the
https://github.com/voomify/egregious project.

We also
created exceptions for each of the http status codes, so that you can throw those exceptions in your code. Its an
easy way to throw the right status code and setup a good message for it. If you want to provide more context, you
can derive you own exceptions and add mappings for them.

Here is an example of throwing a
bad request exception:

```ruby
raise Egregious::BadRequest.new("You can not created an order without a customer.") unless customer_id
```



Egregious adds
mapping of many exceptions, if you have your own rescue_from handlers those will get invoked. You will not lose
any existing behavior, but you also might not see the changes you expect until you remove or modify those
rescue_from calls. At a minimum I suggest using the .to_xml and .to_json calls io your existing rescue_from
methods/blocks.

And finally if you don't like the default behavior. You can override any
portion of it and change it to meet your needs.

If you want to change the behavior then you
can override the following methods in your ApplicationController.

```ruby
# override this if you want your flash to behave differently
def egregious_flash(exception)
    flash.now[:alert] = exception.message
end
```


```ruby
# override this if you want your logging to behave differently
def
      egregious_log(exception)
 logger.fatal(
 "\n\n" + exception.class.to_s + ' (' +
      exception.message.to_s + '):\n ' +
 clean_backtrace(exception).join("\n ") +
 "\n\n")
 HoptoadNotifier.notify(exception) if defined?(HoptoadNotifier)
end
```

```ruby
# override this if you want to change your respond_to behavior
def egregious_respond_to(exception)
 respond_to do |format|
    status = status_code_for_exception(exception)
    format.xml { render :xml=> exception.to_xml, :status => status }
    format.json { render :json=> exception.to_json, :status => status }
      # render the html page for the status we are returning it exists...if not then render the 500.html page.
    format.html { render :file => File.exists?(build_html_file_path(status)) ?
    build_html_file_path(status) : build_html_file_path('500')}
 end
end
```
```ruby
# override this if you want to change what html static file gets returned.
def build_html_file_path(status)
    File.expand_path(Rails.root, 'public', status + '.html')
end
```



```ruby
# override this if you want to control what gets sent to airbrake
# optionally you can configure the airbrake ignore list
def notify_airbrake(exception)
  # tested with airbrake 3.1.15, 4.2.1 and 5.0.5
  if defined?(Airbrake)
    if(Airbrake.respond_to?(:notify_or_ignore))
      env['airbrake.error_id'] = Airbrake.notify_or_ignore(exception) # V4
    else
      env['airbrake.error_id'] = Airbrake.notify(exception) # V5
    end
  end
end
```

We are using this gem in all our Rails projects.

Go forth and be egregious!
